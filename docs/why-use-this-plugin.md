**This page has moved to the [Gatsby monorepo!](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/docs/why-use-this-plugin.md)**

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ thank you so much for being a beta/alpha tester of this plugin!
You've helped us bring a much more stable WordPress integration to Gatsby and we're very thankful for that!

We've shipped this plugin as `gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.0`.
`gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` is now deprecated.
Please upgrade by npm/yarn installing the latest version of the stable plugin and updating your gatsby-config.js to include the stable plugin name.

We've chosen this point to release this plugin as a stable release not because there are no bugs (all software has some bugs), but because this plugin is far more stable than the last major version of `gatsby-source-wordpress`.

Note that we will continue fixing Github issues you've opened in the -experimental repo - those are not forgotten and will be transferred to the Gatsby monorepo.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ

## Why use Gatsby instead of WordPress PHP templates?

For starters you can keep using WordPress as the fantastic CMS it is, and use React and modern tooling for your front-end!

Some highlights:

- Increased security and performance due to the static rendering of Gatsby
- A componentized architecture for your front-end code with React (better maintainability)
- A simpler way of asking for data with GraphQL (no need to remember dozens of data retrieval functions)
- Client-side state management with React opens up the doors to creating an app-like or full on app experience for your users
- [Gatsby is committed to ensuring we are as accessible as possible out of the box](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-18-gatsby-commitment-to-accessibility/)

Additionally, this plugin is a great reason to use Gatsby with WordPress. Many of the complex and difficult aspects of going decoupled with WordPress have been abstracted for you behind the scenes, so you can work on building awesome apps and sites instead of reinventing the wheel to get decoupled WordPress working in your project.

Check out this page on [convincing developers why Gatsby is awesome](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/winning-over-developers/#specific-benefits). It's meant for developers who want to convince their coworkers to use Gatsby, but it actually does a great job of describing directly to you the main reasons why using Gatsby is a great idea :)

## Why use this plugin instead of X source plugin?

Before `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` (soon to be `gatsby-source-wordpress@v4`) was released, there were 2 main ways to work with Gatsby & WordPress: `gatsby-source-wordpress@v3` and `gatsby-source-graphql`.

Both of these worked but each had it's own pitfalls and problems.

- [Problems with gatsby-source-wordpress@v3](./problems-with-v3.md)
- [Problems with gatsby-source-graphql](./problems-with-gatsby-source-graphql.md)

This plugin fixes every problem listed in those two pages :point_up:

Now we have the ability to properly cache data and this makes incremental builds, fast builds, and Preview work. Any WPGraphQL plugin now becomes a cacheable Gatsby plugin which means Gatsby and the community can build a rich plugin ecosystem around WordPress that just works! :smile:
