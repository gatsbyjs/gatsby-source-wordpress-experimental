Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ thank you so much for being a beta/alpha tester of this plugin!
You've helped us bring a much more stable WordPress integration to Gatsby and we're very thankful for that!

We've shipped this plugin as `gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.0`.
`gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` is now deprecated.
Please upgrade by npm/yarn installing the latest version of the stable plugin and updating your gatsby-config.js to include the stable plugin name.

We've chosen this point to release this plugin as a stable release not because there are no bugs (all software has some bugs), but because this plugin is far more stable than the last major version of `gatsby-source-wordpress`.

Note that we will continue fixing Github issues you've opened in the -experimental repo - those are not forgotten and will be transferred to the Gatsby monorepo.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ

# Changing test suite WordPress plugin versions in docker

1. Edit the versions as desired in `docker-compose.yml` in the `build.args` for `wordpress` service
2. Run `yarn docker-start -d` to detach, force re-build images and re-create containers, and ensure the plugins directory (volume) is renewed between builds
3. Run `yarn test-schema`. You should see a diff in the snapshots that demonstrates the change in schema with the changed plugin versions.
4. Run `yarn test-update` to update all test snapshots.
