# Installation & Getting Started :baby_chick:

If you've had previous experience with Gatsby or you like to move fast, you can use the quick start steps below to get up and running quickly. If you'd like to take a step back and learn more first, head over to our [tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) :footprints:

## Quick start

1. [Install Node, Gatsby, and gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
2. Install [a starter](./themes-starters-examples.md) `gatsby new wordpress-gatsby https://github.com/TylerBarnes/using-gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`
3. In the `WordPress/plugins/` directory of [this starter](https://github.com/TylerBarnes/using-gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/tree/master/WordPress/plugins) there are two plugins which both need to be installed into a live WordPress instance

   - [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql)
   - [WPGatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/wp-gatsby)

4. In the `gatsby-config.js` of the starter you just set up, update the plugin options for `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`. Change the `url` option so that it points to your WordPress instance GraphQL url. This should be the full url of your GraphQL endpoint. Eg `https://yoursite.com/graphql`
5. Run `gatsby develop` and experience the magic :star2:
6. Create your beautiful and accessible app :nail_care:
7. Build with [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) & deploy to [Netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/netlify/) for a fast, wonderful, _and_ affordable CI/CD experience :boom: :rocket:

### Hot tip

For a fast, easy, and reliable WordPress local dev server, use [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/). This will save you time setting up WordPress on your computer and you can easily push and pull to and from Flywheel/WPEngine hosting!

## Required WordPress Dependencies

In addition to WordPress, there are 2 other required plugins on the PHP side of things. If you're on the latest version of the source plugin and these plugins, everything will work great. If there is a version mismatch, you'll be notified and provided a download link for the correct versions in your terminal via our [compatibility API](./features/compatibility-api.md) when you run a build :smile:

### WPGraphQL

This plugin turns your WordPress instance into a GraphQL server.

- [Docs](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/)
- [Website](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)

### WPGatsby

This plugin modifies the WPGraphQL schema in Gatsby-specific ways and also keeps a record of when user actions happened. This allows us to do selective cache invalidation in Gatsby (to speed up builds) and add Preview support.

- [Source code](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/wp-gatsby)

### WordPress

Please note that we only officially support the latest version of WordPress. However, WordPress is great at keeping backwards compatibility and older versions may work.
