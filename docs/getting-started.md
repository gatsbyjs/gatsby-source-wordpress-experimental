**This page has moved to the [Gatsby monorepo!](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/docs/getting-started.md)**

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ thank you so much for being a beta/alpha tester of this plugin!
You've helped us bring a much more stable WordPress integration to Gatsby and we're very thankful for that!

We've shipped this plugin as `gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.0`.
`gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` is now deprecated.
Please upgrade by npm/yarn installing the latest version of the stable plugin and updating your gatsby-config.js to include the stable plugin name.

We've chosen this point to release this plugin as a stable release not because there are no bugs (all software has some bugs), but because this plugin is far more stable than the last major version of `gatsby-source-wordpress`.

Note that we will continue fixing Github issues you've opened in the -experimental repo - those are not forgotten and will be transferred to the Gatsby monorepo.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ



# Installation & Getting Started :baby_chick:

If you've had previous experience with Gatsby or you like to move fast, you can use the quick start steps below to get up and running quickly. If you'd like to take a step back and learn more first, head over to our [tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) :footprints:

## Quick start

1. [Install Node, Gatsby, and gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
2. Install [a starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-blog) `gatsby new my-wordpress-gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-blog`
3. Install and activate both of the following plugins in a live WordPress instance.

   - [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
   - [WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/)

4. In the `gatsby-config.js` of the starter you just set up, update the plugin options for `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`. Change the `url` option so that it points to your WordPress instance GraphQL url. This should be the full url of your GraphQL endpoint. Eg `https://yoursite.com/graphql`
5. Run `gatsby develop` and experience the magic :star2:
6. Create your beautiful and accessible app :nail_care:
7. Build with [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) & deploy to [Netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/netlify/) for a fast, wonderful, _and_ affordable CI/CD experience :boom: :rocket:

### Hot tip

For a fast, easy, and reliable WordPress local dev server, use [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/). This will save you time setting up WordPress on your computer and you can easily push and pull to and from Flywheel/WPEngine hosting!

## Required WordPress Dependencies

In addition to WordPress, there are 2 other required plugins on the PHP side of things. If you're on the latest version of the source plugin and these plugins, everything will work great. If there is a version mismatch, you'll be notified and provided a download link for the correct versions in your terminal via our [compatibility API](./features/compatibility-api.md) when you run a build :smile:

### WPGraphQL

This plugin turns your WordPress instance into a GraphQL server.

- [Docs](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/)
- [Website](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)

### WPGatsby

This plugin modifies the WPGraphQL schema in Gatsby-specific ways and also keeps a record of when user actions happened. This allows us to do selective cache invalidation in Gatsby (to speed up builds) and add Preview support.

- [Source code](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/wp-gatsby)

### WordPress

Please note that we only officially support the latest version of WordPress. However, WordPress is great at keeping backwards compatibility and older versions may work.
