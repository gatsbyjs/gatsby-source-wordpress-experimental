Part 1: One-time first set-up
First we’ll create the Starter Site itself.

It needs a permanent home—somewhere you’ll install the Starter Site and keep it maintained and updated.

I suggest you create a ‘subdomain’ of a domain you already own. A subdomain is just a way of creating new websites under your main website domain.

For example: If your main domain was mydomain.com then you could create subdomains of it (totally separate websites), like test.mydomain.com and clientname.mydomain.com. Handy!

As cPanel is a very common hosting control panel, I’ll give you instructions for that. It’s also the control panel on my absolute favourite WordPress hosting company.

If your host has a different control panel, I’m sure the process is easy. Just ask them.

1.1 Create a subdomain for your Starter Site:
1. Login to your cPanel.

2. Click ‘Subdomains‘.
3. Give your subdomain a name.I chose to call mine ‘starter‘ (see screenshot below).

By default, the Document Root will be filled in automatically for you like this:

public_html/starter

This will create a folder in the ‘root’ of your server called ‘starter‘.
