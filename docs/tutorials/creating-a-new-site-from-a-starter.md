Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ thank you so much for being a beta/alpha tester of this plugin!
You've helped us bring a much more stable WordPress integration to Gatsby and we're very thankful for that!

We've shipped this plugin as `gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.0`.
`gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` is now deprecated.
Please upgrade by npm/yarn installing the latest version of the stable plugin and updating your gatsby-config.js to include the stable plugin name.

We've chosen this point to release this plugin as a stable release not because there are no bugs (all software has some bugs), but because this plugin is far more stable than the last major version of `gatsby-source-wordpress`.

Note that we will continue fixing Github issues you've opened in the -experimental repo - those are not forgotten and will be transferred to the Gatsby monorepo.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ



# Creating a new site from a starter

This is the recommended way to build new sites so that you start with good best practises and don't need to re-implement everything yourself.

## Setting up WordPress

If you don't have a WP site yet, we recommend creating a local WP instance using [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) but as long as you have a WP instance hosted somewhere you're good to get started.

Log into your WP instance and navigate to `/wp-admin/plugin-install.php`. Once you're there, search for and install these two plugins:

- [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
- [WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/)

We need WPGraphQL so that we have an efficient and flexible way for `gatsby-source-wordpress` to pull data into Gatsby.
WPGatsby is also required as it sets up a WP admin event log that Gatsby will use to pull content changes into Gatsby after our initial build. It also offers some additional features like [Gatsby Preview](../features/preview.md) and [webhooks](./configuring-wp-gatsby.md) to kick off builds on your build service when content changes in WP.

## Setting up Gatsby

First you'll need to ensure you have npm, Gatsby, and Nodejs installed on your computer. Follow the [GatsbyJS guide on setting up your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/).

## Setting up `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`

You're super close to being able to run your new Gatsby/WP site now!

1. In a terminal, `cd` (navigate) to the directory you want your Gatsby site to live in.
2. To create a new site using the official WP Gatsby starter, run `gatsby new my-wordpress-gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-blog`. That will fetch [this starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-blog) and put it in a new directory called `my-wordpress-gatsby-site` and run `npm install`.

Now that you have a local Gatsby site installed, open it in your favourite IDE or text editor and open up the `gatsby-config.js` file.
At the top of the `plugins` array you'll see the following code:

```js
    {
      /**
       * First up is the WordPress source plugin that connects Gatsby
       * to your WordPress site.
       *
       * visit the plugin docs to learn more
       * https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/blob/master/README.md
       *
       */
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        // the only required plugin option for WordPress is the GraphQL url.
        url:
          process.env.WPGRAPHQL_URL ||
          `https://wpgatsbydemo.wpengine.com/graphql`,
      },
    },
```

As you can see, the `url` option is the only required option. You will want to replace this with the URL of the `/graphql` endpoint you added by installing WPGraphQL in your WP instance. Out of the box WPGraphQL will add the GraphQL endpoint at `http://[yoursite.com]/graphql`.

```js
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        url: `https://demo.wpgraphql.com/graphql`,
      },
    },
```

## Running the site

Now that you have the source plugin configured you can check it out by `cd`ing into your site directory in a terminal and running `gatsby develop`. You should see the plugin output some lines in your terminal showing which types of data it's fetching from WPGraphQL. On the first build (`gatsby develop` or `gatsby build`) `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` will fetch all available public data from WPGraphQL. On subsequent builds, it will only fetch changed data to keep your builds quick.

Open http://localhost:8000 in the browser to view your site.

## Modifying the starter code

For a guide on how different parts of the code work, check out this [gatsbyjs.com guide on using WordPress data](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/sourcing-data/sourcing-from-wordpress/#using-wordpress-data).

## Helpful plugin options for larger sites

If you have a larger site you may find that the amount of time it takes for you to run `gatsby develop` is too long. Any time you add a new npm package, edit your `gatsby-config.js` or `gatsby-node.js` files, Gatsby will clear the cache and the source plugin will need to re-fetch all data. We can mitigate that with a couple options:

### Limiting the amount of data fetched with the `options.type.[typename].limit` option

```js
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        url: `https://demo.wpgraphql.com/graphql`,
        type: {
            __all: {
                limit: process.env.NODE_ENV === `development` ? 50 : null
            }
        }
      },
    },
```

This option will limit the total number of nodes fetched per-type. In this example we're using the special `__all` type which applies to all node types. If you wanted to change the limit based on a specific type you could do something like this:

```js
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        url: `https://demo.wpgraphql.com/graphql`,
        type: {
            Post: {
                limit: 50
            },
            Page: {
                limit: 50
            }
        }
      },
    },
```

Note that `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? 50 : null` will apply this limit only during development while `limit: 50` will apply a limit during development and in production builds.

### Hard caching MediaItem local files in development using the `options.develop.hardCacheMediaFiles` option

When the Gatsby cache is cleared all image files that the source plugin fetched from WordPress will be deleted. That means they will then need to be immediately re-downloaded when you run `gatsby develop` again. We can eliminate this problem in development with the `hardCacheMediaFiles` option:

```js
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        url: `https://demo.wpgraphql.com/graphql`,
        develop: {
            hardCacheMediaFiles: true,
        }
      },
    },
```

Now you'll only ever need to fetch media item files 1 time on your local machine.
