**This page has moved to the [Gatsby monorepo!](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/docs/features/preview.md)**

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ thank you so much for being a beta/alpha tester of this plugin!
You've helped us bring a much more stable WordPress integration to Gatsby and we're very thankful for that!

We've shipped this plugin as `gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.0`.
`gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` is now deprecated.
Please upgrade by npm/yarn installing the latest version of the stable plugin and updating your gatsby-config.js to include the stable plugin name.

We've chosen this point to release this plugin as a stable release not because there are no bugs (all software has some bugs), but because this plugin is far more stable than the last major version of `gatsby-source-wordpress`.

Note that we will continue fixing Github issues you've opened in the -experimental repo - those are not forgotten and will be transferred to the Gatsby monorepo.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ



# Preview

This plugin supports [Preview](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/preview/) and has been designed to replicate the normal WordPress admin preview experience as closely as possible.

## How Preview works

When configured properly by a developer, preview should function almost identically to how it does in regular WordPress. The admin updates content and presses "preview" and the preview template opens and displays the preview.

## Setting up Preview

You can find our tutorial on setting up WPGatsby [here](../tutorials/configuring-wp-gatsby.md#setting-up-preview). Part-way down the page there are instructions you can follow on setting up Preview.

## Gutenberg and ACF

Note that if you use these two together, you cannot preview ACF data. This is a core WordPress Gutenberg issue. Follow https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16006 for more information. If you use ACF and would like to preview data changes, use the Classic Editor plugin for now.

## Template safety

Be sure to guard against missing data in your templates using optional chaining so that missing data doesn't cause template errors. Trying to access properties on undefined will break your preview. For example, if you try to access `wpPost.acfFieldGroup.hero.content` but your Preview template receives `null` for `wpPost.acfFieldGroup`, your preview template will break.

To guard against this you can use optional chaining by writing `wpPost?.acfFieldGroup?.hero?.content` instead.

## Debugging Previews in React

Since a Previewed post might have a lot less data attached to it than what you're testing with during development, you might get errors in previews when that data is missing. You can debug your previews by running Gatsby in preview mode locally.

- Run Gatsby in refresh mode with `ENABLE_GATSBY_REFRESH_ENDPOINT=true gatsby develop`
- Install ngrok with `npm i -g ngrok`
- In a new terminal window run `ngrok http 8000`
- In your WP instance's GatsbyJS settings, set your Preview instance URL to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io` and your Preview webhook to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/__refresh`

Now when you click the preview button in `wp-admin` it will use your local instance of Gatsby. You can inspect the preview template to see which Gatsby page is being loaded in the preview iframe and open it directly to do further debugging.

## Debugging the build process of Previews

If you enable the plugin option `options.debug.preview` by setting it to `true`, you will see additional logging through the Preview build process with information such as the contents of the webhook body that was sent to Gatsby, the preview node data, and the list of preview actions that were pulled from WordPress. See the [plugin options](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/blob/master/docs/plugin-options.md#debugpreview) documentation for more info.

## Common gatsby-node.js problems that break previews

### 1. When querying for nodes, the previewed node is filtered out

Make sure that when `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"` you aren't filtering your `gatsby-node.js` node queries. For example, the following will break Previews:

```js
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql }) => {
  const graphqlResult = await graphql(/* GraphQL */ `
    query {
      allWpPost(filter: { status: { eq: "publish" } }) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            uri
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)
}
```

Filtering by a specific category can also break previews since adding categories to posts is not previewable in WordPress:

```js
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql }) => {
  const graphqlResult = await graphql(/* GraphQL */ `
    query {
      allWpPost(
        filter: {
          categories: { nodes: { elemMatch: { name: { eq: "Blog" } } } }
        }
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            uri
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)
}
```

### 2. Not including the node id in pageContext

It is currently a hard requirement that the node id is added to pageContext.

```js
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const graphqlResult = await graphql(/* GraphQL */ `
    query {
      allWpPost {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            uri
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  graphqlResult.data.allWpPost.edges.map(({ node }) => {
    actions.createPage({
      path: node.uri,
      component: require.resolve(`./src/components/dog.js`),
      context: {
        id: node.id, // if this is not included, previews will not work.
      },
    })
  })
}
```

## Built in Preview plugin options preset

In order to speed up previews, there are some built in default plugin options for when your Gatsby site is in Preview mode. This preset disables static asset transformations in html fields and limits the number of nodes initially fetched during a cold build. You can disable this preset by passing `null` to the preset option. Any options you've set yourself will override the preset options.

```js
{
    resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
    options: {
        url: `https://your-site.com/graphql`,
        presets: null
    }
}
```

The preset (as found in src/models/gatsby-api.ts) is:

```ts
{
  // this is an internal name
  presetName: `PREVIEW_OPTIMIZATION`,

  // these are the conditions the preset will be added under
  useIf: () => inDevelopPreview || inPreviewRunner,

  // these options will be merged into the global default options and your options will be merged into these options
  options: {
    html: {
      useGatsbyImage: false,
      createStaticFiles: false,
    },
    type: {
      __all: {
        //   all nodes are limited to 50 in cold builds
        limit: 50,
      },
      Comment: {
        //   all comments are excluded
        limit: 0,
      },
      //   there's no limit to the following three types in cold builds
      Menu: {
        limit: null,
      },
      MenuItem: {
        limit: null,
      },
      User: {
        limit: null,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## How Preview works behind the scenes

When the WP "preview" button is pressed, a JWT is generated (with an expiry time of 1 hour) and POST'ed to the Gatsby Preview instance webhook. The Preview instance then uses this short-lived JWT to request a list of pending previews for all users. Gatsby starts processing each pending preview. At the same time, WordPress automatically opens the WP preview template which has been overridden by WPGatsby. Within the WP preview template you will see the admin bar at the top of the page as usual. The WordPress preview template displays a loader and waits for Gatsby to send back the preview status for the preview you're observing - it will receive a response when the preview has been processed on the Gatsby side. On the Gatsby side, it matches up the node being previewed with the Gatsby page that was created from it, once that page has been updated or created, it sends back the Gatsby page path for that page. WordPress then starts watching for the changed page to be deployed. Once it's deployed, the WordPress preview template loads the right Gatsby page in an iframe and removes the loader. In the case that there are errors on the Gatsby side, or no page is created for the node that's being previewed, Gatsby will send back an appropriate status and WPGatsby will display an error in the browser with instructions on how to resolve the issue.

## Preview Security Considerations

In order to support multiple users previewing simultaneously (and/or content updates happening at the same time as previews), WPGatsby needs to generate a user-agnostic JWT token and post that to Gatsby to pull all pending previews for any variety of users. This JWT can authenticate as any user. What this means is your Gatsby instance is being trusted at the same level as WP core code or WP plugins/themes. You should make sure that only trusted individuals or teams have code-level access to your WP server code/hosting and your Gatsby code/hosting. You should always use SSL for your WP host and your Gatsby Preview instance (on Gatsby Cloud this is taken care of for you). This JWT is only accessible when POST'ed to your Gatsby Preview instance during previews. The settings for where this JWT is POST'ed to can only be configured by administrators (via the WPGatsby settings page) or by anyone with code-level access to your WP instance.

Additionally Gatsby Preview has no conception of user access roles. This means anyone with frontend, GraphiQL, or code level access to your Preview instance can see any currently existing Gatsby Previews that have been processed.
