# Preview

This plugin supports [Preview](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/preview/) and has been designed to replicate the normal WordPress admin preview experience as closely as possible.

## How Preview works

When configured properly by a developer, preview should function almost identically to how it does in regular WordPress. The admin updates content and presses "preview" and the preview template opens and displays the preview.

## Setting up Preview

You can find our tutorial on setting up WPGatsby [here](../tutorials/configuring-wp-gatsby.md#setting-up-preview). Part-way down the page there are instructions you can follow on setting up Preview.

## Template safety

Be sure to guard against missing data in your templates using optional chaining so that missing data doesn't cause template errors. Trying to access properties on undefined will break your preview. For example, if you try to access `wpPost.acfFieldGroup.hero.content` but your Preview template receives `null` for `wpPost.acfFieldGroup`, your preview template will break.

To guard against this you can use optional chaining by writing `wpPost?.acfFieldGroup?.hero?.content` instead.

## Gutenberg and ACF

Note that if you use these two together, you cannot preview ACF data. This is a core WordPress Gutenberg issue. Follow https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16006 for more information. If you use ACF and would like to preview data changes, use the Classic Editor plugin for now.

## Built in Preview plugin options presets

In order to speed up previews, there are some built in default plugin options for when your Gatsby site is in Preview mode. This preset disables static asset transformations in html fields and limits the number of nodes initially fetched during a cold build. You can disable this preset by passing `null` to the preset option.

```js
{
    resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
    options: {
        presets: null
    }
}
```

## Debugging Previews

Since a Previewed post might have a lot less data attached to it than what you're testing with during development, you might get errors in previews when that data is missing. You can debug your previews by running Gatsby in preview mode locally.

- Run Gatsby in refresh mode with `ENABLE_GATSBY_REFRESH_ENDPOINT=true gatsby develop`
- Install ngrok with `npm i -g ngrok`
- In a new terminal window run `ngrok http 8000`
- In your WP instance's GatsbyJS settings, set your Preview instance URL to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io` and your Preview webhook to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/__refresh`

Now when you click the preview button in `wp-admin` it will use your local instance of Gatsby. You can inspect the preview template to see which Gatsby page is being loaded in the preview iframe and open it directly to do further debugging.

## How Preview works behind the scenes

When the WP "preview" button is pressed, a JWT is generated (with an expiry time of 30 seconds) and POST'ed to the Gatsby Preview instance webhook. The Preview instance then uses this short-lived JWT to request preview data for the page or post that's being previewed. At the same time, WordPress automatically opens the WP preview template which has been overridden by WPGatsby. Within the WP preview template you will see the admin bar at the top of the page as usual. The WordPress preview template displays a loader and waits for Gatsby to send back the preview status, it will receive a response when the preview has been processed on the Gatsby side. On the Gatsby side, it matches up the node being previewed with the Gatsby page that was created from it, once that page has been updated or created, it sends back the Gatsby page path for that page. The WordPress preview template then loads the right Gatsby page in an iframe and removes the loader. In the case that there are errors on the Gatsby side, or no page is created for the node that's being previewed, Gatsby will send back an appropriate status and WPGatsby will display an error in the browser with instructions on how to resolve the issue.
