# Media Item handling

Only media items that are referenced by at least 1 node are sourced.
This means if you have 10,000 images in your WordPress instance, but only 1 of those images is used in your site, you will only need to wait for 1 image to download. It's a common scenario for admins to upload 5-10x more images than they use, and that is the reason this feature exists. Currently there is no way to pull all Media Items, but if you need this feature please open an issue (or search for an existing one and thumbs up it).
