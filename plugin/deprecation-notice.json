"Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ thank you so much for being a beta/alpha tester of this plugin!\nYou've helped us bring a much more stable WordPress integration to Gatsby and we're very thankful for that!\n\nWe've shipped this plugin as `gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.0`.\n`gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` is now deprecated.\nPlease upgrade by npm/yarn installing the latest version of the stable plugin and updating your gatsby-config.js to include the stable plugin name.\n\nWe've chosen this point to release this plugin as a stable release not because there are no bugs (all software has some bugs), but because this plugin is far more stable than the last major version of `gatsby-source-wordpress`.\n\nNote that we will continue fixing Github issues you've opened in the -experimental repo - those are not forgotten and will be transferred to the Gatsby monorepo.\n\nThank you! ðŸ’œ\n\n"
