 * have callbacks hanging around and WP will not know the status of the preview
 * So in onPreExtractQueries (which runs after pages are created), we check which
 * preview callbacks haven't been invoked, and invoke them with a "NO_PAGE_CREATED_FOR_PREVIEWED_NODE" status, which sends that status to WP
 * After invoking all these leftovers, we clear them out from the store so they aren't called again later.
