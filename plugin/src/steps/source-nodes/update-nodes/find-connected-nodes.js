// After all nodes are created while building the schema, store possible node type relationships. So for example when building the WpPost type, for every gatsby node discovered as a potential connected node type WpPost's fields, record that in redux as WpPost => [...ConnectedTypeNames].

// when creating or updating a Page incrementally, we should find all connected node ids, check the types of each of those id's, if any connected id type has the current node type as a potential connected node type, AND this node is not a connected node of that node, we should refetch that node in case it's now a connected node.

// So we create a new Page, we then check the connected node id's and determine that one of them is a User type. The User type has Page as a potential connected node. So we check if this node is a connected node of that node. If it's not we can't be sure that that User node isn't missing this node as a connected node. So we refetch the connected node of our Page which is a User. Do this for all connected nodes where we can't find a relationship back.
