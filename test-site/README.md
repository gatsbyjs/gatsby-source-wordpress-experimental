# gatsby-source-wordpress V4 (alpha) starter

**WARNING:** this is a work in progress. There will be bugs. Features and api's may dramatically change in this starter and the new source plugin it's using. Don't use this in production. Do try this if you know what you're doing and are experienced with Gatsby and WPGraphQL. This starter is also not thoroughly considered and was written quickly to show how to set-up the new plugin.

## Intro

This starter uses an early alpha version of the upcoming `gatsby-source-wordpress@v4`. For now, the only documentation that exists is here in this starter. That will soon change - better docs will be written and moved to the Gatsby repo as features solidify and things become more stable.

## Installation

- Install Gatsby and gatsby-cli
- Set up this starter locally `gatsby new wordpress-v4 https://github.com/TylerBarnes/using-gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`
- In the `WordPress/plugins/` directory of this starter there are two plugins which both need to be installed into a live WordPress installation
  - WPGraphQL v0.6.1 - this adds GraphQL to our WordPress server
  - WPGatsby v0.0.1 - this modifies the WPGQL schema and records when user actions have happened to allow us to do selective cache invalidation in Gatsby (to speed up builds).
  - For now, ignore the update notification for WPGatsby on the plugins page in wp-admin https://github.com/TylerBarnes/using-gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental/issues/1.

## Getting started

- In `gatsby-config.js`, update the plugin options for `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`
  - Change `url` to point to your WordPress install. This should be the full url of your graphql endpoint. Eg `https://yoursite.com/graphql`
  - The `nodeUpdateInterval` option specifies in milliseconds how often Gatsby will ask WP what data has changed during development. If you want to see data update in near-realtime while you're developing, set this low. Your server may have trouble responding to too many requests over a long period of time and in that case, set this high. Setting it higher saves electricity too ⚡️🌲
- in .env.GATSBY_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOAD, set how many concurrent connections your server can handle. If this plugin knocks your server over and it stops responding, lower the concurrent connections.

## Cool features

- Automatically pulls as much of the remote WPGQL schema as possible and creates Gatsby nodes from that data. Data is never fetched twice. If we will already have data, for example on a connection field between an Author and a Post, we only pull the id of the Post and link the field to the Post node in Gatsby.
- After the first build or run of develop only changed data is pulled.
- Only referenced media items and files are downloaded. If you have a site where an admin has uploaded 10k images but there are only 1k pages, we don't want to have to pull all those images, just the ones that are used. That's the default behaviour of the source plugin. There is also an option to lazily download files as they're queried for, but it's currently problematic for some CI providers, it messes up cli output, and Gatsby currently only runs 4 gql queries concurrently which slows down file fetching. This will work in the future though!
- Potentially works with all (or most) WPGQL plugins. So ACF, polylang, etc will work. See "known issues" below if a plugin doesn't work.
- Do you have a site with 50k posts and you want to do some quick development on it? You can limit the amount of nodes that will be pulled by setting an option to limit the amount of posts that will be pulled (by typename) in the plugin options. For example, you can get working quickly by setting the plugin to only pull 10 posts.
- If the remote schema changes between builds, the entire cache will be invalidated and the plugin will start a fresh pull/build.
- Lot's of other things :p will write more/actual documentation as features solidify

## Recommendations

- For now I recommend hosting on pantheon (or another high-performance WP host) for your remote WP server, and using Local by Flywheel (upgrade to the latest version for ultra-speed) to do local development. You can use this with other setups, but it may be less enjoyable if your server is slower than the recommended setup. More work will be done in the future to ensure this works well on all types of hosts.
- Stick to WPGraphQL v0.6.x for now, as previous or future versions may not yet work with the new source plugin (untested)

## Debugging

If you're getting errors while the nodes are being sourced, you can see which query had the error with the following options:

```js
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
  options: {
    debug: {
      graphql: {
        showQueryOnError: true,
        showQueryVarsOnError: true,
        copyQueryOnError: true,
        panicOnError: true,
      },
    },
  }
}
```

## Super rough and unscientific benchmarks using pantheon as a host

- With a 6k page site that has 5k images and 12k image transforms - Gatsby cloud built this in 20 minutes. A second rebuild with some changed content took 2 minutes.
- With a 500 page site with 500 images - Gatsby cloud built this in 3:30 and a second rebuild with changed content took 1 minute.
- locally these both build in 20 seconds on a second run. re-starting your development server always takes around 12 seconds regardless of the size of your site.

## Known issues

- This starter doesn't build it's Styled components properly
- WPGatsby doesn't use the build webhook in settings
- The cache isn't selectively invalidated for every possible user interaction. For now this only works for creating/updating/deleting/reattributing users and adding or removing them based on if their profile is public or not, creating/deleting/drafting/updating posts/pages/CPT's, editing/creating/deleting media items, and adding/editing/deleting categories/terms/tags.
- Changing the homepage doesn't invalidate the cache
- If you use any additional plugins that modify the WPGQL schema, and those plugins API's haven't been designed to have all their fields fetched at once, you may get errors. The reason this happens is that `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` looks at the remote schema, constructs a GraphQL query for every possible field we could fetch, and then attempts to fetch that data. This only happens on the first build or first run of develop, and then on subsequent builds/develops it only pulls changed data since the last time. This has the effect of validating the remote schema in ways that are normally tedious or difficult to do for plugin authors, so you may see errors related to this. If you do, you can get around it by omitting certain fields from the remote schema in plugin options. For example, to support wp-graphql-gutenberg, I've excluded the `attributes` field here, as it's problematic to fetch all attributes at once. The api for working around this will be changed and future work to prevent these kinds of errors will be done to `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental` to mitigate this.
- Probably other things :p
